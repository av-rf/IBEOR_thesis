This repository containts the code for a bachelor thesis in Econometrics and Operations Research: Decomposed WindowSHAP. This research builds on WindowSHAP (Nayebi et al., 2023), by applying seasonal decomposition to stock pricing data and computing SHAP values per window, feature, and component on LSTM predictions. This improves interpetability on the drivers of complex machine learning models.
